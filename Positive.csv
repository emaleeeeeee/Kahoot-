"My students and I love Kahoot! I love the ability to create my own games which we can use to review content or even to pre-assess new content. The fact that the mobile option was added during Covid-19 made the site even sweeter. Teachers can now assign a game and put a start and end time. After that, students who can see who won. This really allows everyone to stay connected even when they are not together."
"As a fifth grade teacher, I also love the availability of games that were not made by me but are still applicable. If we have extra time, I can load a game on a relevant topic and we are ready to play within only a couple of minutes."
Many students thrive on competitiveness and this allows them to give their all.
"Students get excited to use this, and that's the best thing about it. Students actually request we use it in class when reviewing content and vocabulary. It's easy to use as a teacher."
"When in terms of online games ,i really prefer this online app, it's easy to search, easy to learn, easy to understand the game mechanics, it gives adrenaline to the participants, another source of bonding with colleagues, another source of fun and games. I"
This can play with so many players.
Simple to use format makes it easy for me to quickly and efficiently create engaging quizzes for my class. The students are able to play the quizzes as if it's a game and I find that material is retained better.
 I like the online quiz functionality. My colleagues and I have been forced to work remotely the last few months due to lockdowns. We use Kahoot weekly to play fun games together in company wide meetings for prizes. It's a great way to bond with coworkers when working remotely. The quizes are fun and the way they calculate the score is based off if your answer is correct and the time it took you to answer. These games can get very competitive when prizes are on the line!
 The interface is very user friendly that anyone could figure it out instantly. The way to connect to a game online is also very simple. I like everything about Kahoot!
" My favorite thing about Kahoot is that my students think it is a game and not an assessment or learning tool. Any time I use a Kahoot as a formative assessment at the end of a lesson, my students are excited to play, even at times that they may not have enjoyed the lesson content. In addition, Kahoot offers tools to review your students answers post-game and to break down which questions may need to be covered again before a quiz or test."
" I love that Kahoot! has an app to help facilitate participation in live quizzes and games. We're all on our phones anyway, so it's a great way to feel like you are playing a game. I also love that there is the option to create your own quizzes, or use premade quizzes (a holiday quiz, for example)."
" Kahoot is a great way to bring up the energy level in a classroom or even corporate setting. The platform is based on selecting multiple choice answers from a given question, and the faster the correct answer is chosen, the more points that are give to the participant. After each question, a leaderboard is shown. Kahoot quizzes are made by many contributors, many of which are public and can be played and assigned by anyone, or can be duplicated and edited. Even the ""waiting room"" music is fun. Personally, the smooth and professional design is what seals the deal in my book. It makes it look intriguing and not at all clunky for students."
" Kahoot provides a very interactive and engaging platform where people can learn through games. Schools, universities, and many other organizations use it to conduct online quizzes and many other fun activities through which students and employees can learn and understand new things. Kahoot is vey easy to use and even a first tim user can easilynavigate through the website."
" The engagement factor and how it is adaptable inside the classroom. Students seem to love this program. Great for educational use as learning becomes a game, and friendly competition among students pushes them to understand what the teacher is teaching. I think the ability to add images and Youtube videos to the Kahoots adds even more to the interactivity of the platform. And I love having students create their own games and share those with the class."
 Kahoot allows to generate small quizes that can be used for multiple objectives like just having fun with it by creating competetions and small presentations just to keep everyone entertained in these tough times or it can also be used to have some serious question where the opinion of everyone is required and some decisions are to be made based on that.
" The easy way to organize quizzes or games in activities like training, seminars, or webinars using the individual devices of the participants like mobile phones, tablets, or laptops. Using this software, the collecting of answers is easy, and get the score of each player and quickly determine who the winner is, mainly if there are many partcipants. It's a fun way to have this kind of software in games or quizzes at this time that everything is almost online. As a participant, I can make my nickname of whatever I want."
" The best thing about Kahoot is how it engages the students. They answer questions and can see what their peers are answering. Additionally, they compete with each other but in a way that is friendly. The students are then motivated and engaged in the class content. Other teachers also have created Kahoots that I can publically view and adapt to my class' lessons, which makes it a little bit easier for a teacher to put something together a lot more quickly. The pace can be adjusted to support students' needs."
" The thing I like the most about Kahoot is that it is a fun way to check for my student's understanding of concepts; they get excited to play Kahoot when in actuality, it is actually a test that gives me great information as to what concepts are being mastered and what we still need to work on."
 Student engagement. The questions can be assigned so anyone can play at anytime. People are competive and trivia is a fun game.
 Students and staff get into the Khoots.
 I find Kahoot a fun platform that allows you to create amazing games with fun quizzes. We use Kahoot primarily for team meetups and networking sessions. It is fun and easy to use.
 My students absolutely love Kahoot! It keeps them engaged and keeps review fun and active. Everyday they ask to play. I love how simple it is to set up and project on a screen.
" The best thing about Kahoot is that it is a formative assessment that allows me to monitor student understanding of a topic as I teach it, but my students think of it as a game. Because of this, they all participate to the best of their ability and give me the most accurate representation of their understanding."
" I love that you can quickly search their database for created games that align with the topic you need. While it is easy to create your own game, it is time-saving if you can find one already created."
" I love how Kahoot allows all of my students to interact with class materials. Since they now all have laptops or tablets, it is easy for them to get on Kahoot and play the games that I create or find for them. Kahoot is one of my favorite ways for them to study or review materials, as well as to see what they know before we start different topics."
 Kahoot is a very fun way to engage students as they review material. The previously made ones on the Kahoot! Discover page are such a great resource for teachers in a hurry. It also lets you have in-person and virtual people participate. I like that you can pause the game to have time to cover questions that students may have struggled with. It also saves a report of each student's progress which is really helpful to communicate with parents. I use it when a student is not particpating and a parent feels concerned about their progress. It is a good way to have evidence for in class behaviors.
" Kahoot is great it helps in organizing quizzes with ease and the innovative way in which the only user has to select q answer makes it very convenient to use, Kahoot has multiple uses from friendly competitions among colleagues to using it to create just a fun quiz and know everyone's perspective towards something. Kahoot has a new way of organizing the quizzes and since its browser bases, it doesn't need any download which makes it more convenient to use."
 What I like the most about Kahoot! is how engaging and fun it is to both host and play a kahoot.
" I like how easy it is to create a kahoot from zero, and the platform is very intuitive and user-friendly."
 I also enjoy a lot the mobile app in which I can save all my reports from past kahoots and play them to unlock emoticons and so on.
" Overall, Kahoot is a great platform to host quizzes, and I could easily recommend it to anyone."
" Being live and interactive quiz platform, it has a great UI and gives an excellent experience. Its easy to use and in most cases, it just needs and the Game pin to join and takes only seconds."

It is an easy way to get kids engaged in reviewing a concept or to use for a reward/party day.
I like the versatility of Kahoot and how you can create anything from a study quiz to test retention of material to a fun party quiz you can use for a contest at a holiday work or school party. It can be used for education and fun.
"During the Kahoot! Pro free trial, it was great to use the online survey mechanic for a group presentation. However, I soon realised I could have achieved what I wanted with the free account version, but despite it wasn't able to get a refund. Do not subscribe for the week trial!"
It is easy to use but always surprises and creates fun for the people participating
"I love how awesome, fun and interesting Kahoot makes learning. My students and I love using Kahoot to review grammar topics and vocabulary seen in class, we also use it to review history and geography. It's an interactive platform and it allows me to see live progress in my students, plus I love that it allows me to download the score and keep it as a record."
"The fact that Kahoot is such a fun game. Where you can attract more people who's part of your meeting let's say engage with you. You can also add some twist there like using your screen name to make the fun more exciting. Also using the Kahoot is convenient since you can not just access it to your web browser but to your mobile phone at any time, as long as you have the code in joining the Kahoot you and your other colleague can enjoy it together!"
"I like the funky interface, option to customise quizzes with music and background images. It gives multiple choice, true/false, option to give each question different weightage and availability on mobile phone for easy access. While pluing keep the audience enagged because of the scoreboard appearing after every answer."
The introduction/teaching tools to show new concepts and gauge student background knowledge.
" I like the option to create your own quizzes, polls, etc or use ones created by others. It is easy to use, engaging, and fun. Love the graphics and music choices!"

" It is an inventive and creative format in its entirety, since its tools are necessary for environments based on colorful and vibrant designs, which allow us to create very attractive content to carry out more effective works of its success once said illustration is promoted through of this incredible application, I love its location of the space of each option of use, a fairly clean sheet to start developing activities, and among other highlights of great importance for the educational presentations that you want to carry out."
" Learning has finally gotten fun! In this challenging game of only four options per question, the student's job is to pick the correct answer in the lowest amount of time. The students have fun, the teacher has a new learning tool and parents are seeing their students succeed in the overall academic studies. I can easily create Kahoots using designated templates or to create my own straight from scratch. When I don't have any ideas on how to create a Kahoot, I could simply search for one another teacher has created that directly correlates with the subject I am teaching on hand."
" Fun for the kids! They love the competitiveness of the game, and often forget they are learning!"
 I love that I can quickly assess how well the students understood information.
" Kahoot is incredibly engaging! Students love the competitive aspect and the music. As a teacher, I love being able to search questions from other quizzes to add to my own quiz, which saves so much time."
 Fun to play the games with friends and family.
" I love that Kahoot! makes it very easy to create fun and interactive content to use in my classroom. There is virtually no learning curve and the students seem to catch on to how the website / app works almost immediately. I use it for reviewing content that we cover in class and making the content more fun and interactive by including images and trick answer choices. Kahoot! offers a lot of features, even on their free plan, that make creating a game fun and interactive. You can set specific time limits for questions, add images or video clips to make the questions more dynamic, and of course you have complete control over which answers you mark as correct. It does all of the work scoring the game itself and at the very end it shows the top three players. It also has a scoreboard that updates as you play the game to keep everyone interested and up to date on who is scoring the most."
" I really like Kahoot's point system, which tallies correct responses and the speed of responses to calcuate a score for each user. It's an exciting and competitive game, and brings a lot of fun into quizzing. This software is perfect as a fun way to test participant's knowledge, especially after a training or educational event.

"Kahoot es una herramienta online gratuita que solo requiere de una conexión a internet, unordenador del creador del juego en kahoot con proyector conectado y tantos dispositivos como usuarios participen."
Lo mejor de kahoot es que capta en segundos la atención del que participa.

 This is a great tool to gain a general understanding of where your class stands in terms of content comprehension.
 Kahoot es una herramienta que nos permite tres cosas:
" - Test divertidos de múltiplkes respuestas, a los que podemos añadir imágenes y música. Muy útil después de un curso de formación para evaluar resultados de los conocimientos adquiridos."

" En las 4 opciones, podemos descargar mediante un excel los resultados generados por los miembros de nuestro equipo."
 Simplemente hace falta un proyector y diferentes dispostivos con conexión en red.
" En el proyector aparecerán las preguntas, tema del debate, preguntas de la encuesta, etc y cada miembro de nuestro equipo de trabajo responderá de forma anónima desde su smartphone."

" - divertido, mejora las relaciones del ambiente laboral."
" - no requiere de instalación, tan solo un navegador."

" Kahoot es una divertida aplicación en línea que incluye 4 modos de uso. Lo que tienen en común los 4 modos es que el formador desde su ordenador y con ayuda de un proyector muestra en una pantalla que todos pueden ver el enunciado de una cuestíon, y los demás responden desde el dispositivo que prefieran, obteniendo recompensas en función de la rápidez y de la elección de la respuesta correcta."
 Las tres modalidades son:
 - Quiz: permite realizar preguntas ofreciendo varias respuestas alternativas. Te va a permitir después de impartir un curso de formación repasar los principales conceptos adquiridos con todos los implicados en base a tres modalidades de juego.
 - Jumbler: Debes poner en orden 4 hechos o evidencias.
 - Survey: Para realizar encuestas y obtener feedback de tu audiencia.
 - Discussion: se genera un debate y la gente se posiciona.
 Las 4 pueden ser perfectamente utilizadas en reuniones de equipo para facilitar la toma de decisiones o para comprobar de manera dinámica y favoreciendo la cohesión de grupo que después de un curso de formación se han adquirido los conocimientos previstos.
 Facilitas también el intercambio de ideas y fomentar la participación de los miembros de tu equipo.
" Lo mejor es que es gratis y no necesitas instalar absolutamente nada, ni siquiera registrarte excepto en el caso del administrador, que deberá elaborar las preguntas y decidir los temas de discusión."
" Es muy fácil de usar, tanto como usuario, como administrador pues posee una interfaz muy intuitiva."
" This is a great looking, fun quiz game that can be easily altered for any learning material. A great way to spice up training."

 I can study in a competitive environment and have fun while doing so.
" It’s easy to use, colourful and the music is very entertaining"
 I love that the students get excited about Kahoot! Games!
 That you can see real time results on the big screen
" Great online platform that doesn’t require installment or additional add ones on a computer and it’s easy access to be used in a phone , Laptop or tablet. Modifying the questions by adding pictures or charts is a big factor when educating students because they need visualization. It’s also a friendly competition game that inspires children to achieve certain number of questions correct in order to be rewarded"
 I like the setup and design of the software. Colorful and engaging
 I love the real time interaction with the audience.
 Different way to learn as it’s more interactive
 I enjoy being able to create a quiz easily and make a fun activity for my students. It is also easy to navigate and use quizzes created by other users.
 It is very easy to create your own quizzes or you can use quizzes that have already been created by other users. The students are engaged and answer the questions and gives both teacher and student instant feedback that they can use to fuel discussion.
" I like to use Kahoot to help my students prepare for a quiz, test, or any other assessment."
 I love how easy it is to collect data from over thousands of people in a short amount of time at the same room via using this application.
" I like how user friendly it is, both for the person making the quiz and the people taking it. You can customize it to fit your needs, but doing so is not difficult."
The number of times I have used Elementor is really much and I have not encountered any of its setbacks. I think it has none.
"The application can only be used within the company premises on the company intranet thus making it hard to access this important information while outside. Chrome is a browser that Google offers. This interface offers the most intelligent integrated tools on the web, which makes it easier to concentrate on what interests you."
Dropbox Business is the best of the kind and has given us the best we can get in storing and sharing files. I have nothing to complain about it so far.
Quick login configuration and without many problems. It integrates well in the mobile device. It contains elements to edit and design small organization projects based on real time.
"There isn't much I don't like about the product, I would just be nitpicking to put something in here. I think the error script for failed processes could be a little more visual."

Ningún esquema presentado tiene la seguridad que Basecamp tiene en términos de ventas; Esto parece ser inapropiado debido a las condiciones ofrecidas por esta herramienta.
"I have no resent using this tool, it's working well for me. No dislikes."
"With this application I have achieved a degree of accuracy with which I have managed to generate significant profits too much UI may add overhead to users development phase. A feature could be added to track single member’s contribution to the software. There is a learning curve if the user hasn’t used a project management software before. Buffer represents for me a complete platform that provides us with everything necessary to carry out the management of publications on social networks. Simple for programming and publishing content on major social platforms, it is super intuitive, economical."
 I have no complaints with quire since it reliable with task management.
" It would be additional acceptable if it's to use less RAM however it provides most functions that this downside may be unnoticed by the users. Sometimes the user interface is buggy depending on the version of windows you have. This software so far has been amazing, and I am hard-pressed to find any flaws with it other than the UI"
 It is incredible that this application allows low income people to acquire a good nutrition with little money
" I used it in my past job, just signedup again today to manage my team and i love how easy it is to schedule post and publish to twitter, facebook and Linkedin :) I would like to thank Windows Communication foundation for the best time of my life.

I Dislike the timing and closure of this protrude of this product. knowing that I would upgrade to a different product in the meantime. wishing a better time consuming product."
 It is a very simple and easy to use application
" I have nothing that disgusts me, because it is really very good, I can see on the screen of my tab or phone, how I'm going to get to my destination, the only setback is if you do not have an internet signal you can not use the application. The happy with how Amaya makes me to edit websites and pages easily and how it facilitates fast creation of websites.Likewise Amaya is highly customizable to meet all our needs.Moreover to configure this software is less time consuming."
 It has so many features then the user can be a bit lost sometimes as to which animations to use and end result putting to many animations in the presentation making it a movie rather than a presentation. It also has a bit of a learning curve. Recent changes to licensing have increased costs for some customers
" Its very easy to use even for not regular users, it has various options and you can clearly see what does each. It lets you analyze first before deleting anything, this way you can be sure that you are not deleting something that you need. It can free a lot of disk Absolutely nothing. This app has helped me to organize my ideas in a more streamlined fashion instead of ramblings in my Notes app."
" We do not like that its use can not be implemented in some way. Cisco Webex does not offer many options for recording and reading, and its video quality is usually not as high unless the internet connection is in its entirety, which means that from the mobile with data is of poor quality ."
 we have no complaints about this software. It's great.
" I have not found to this day an upset with this wonderful tool, I am completely happy to use it, its features and functions are quite pleasant and satisfactory, I have been able to discover more features every day and I am completely delighted, if any doubt tool made very well.

 With shopify i can create an online business and its also possible to modify it.With shopify i can sell in many places like social media platforms websites and even mobile phones.With shopify there is no worry about upgrading or maintaining software or web servers. To fully utilize the PowerPoint a lot of tutorials are required. It has a lot of templates but I feel they are a bit outdated. Using animations in PowerPoint is a bit difficult as compared to other tools having the same purpose.
 It can be a bit confusing to add information and videos. Sometimes when I try to add a file I am redirected and sometimes I am unable to paste information I have copied.

 Great study technique to do in class
 Very interactive and allows for students to apply what they learn
" Kahoot is a fast way to hook your students and grab their attention. I use kahoot to introduce a new topic, practice a new concept, and review for a test. Kahoot offers more than just quizzes, they allow students to stop and think about a question or discussion point which is a great way to change up a lesson plan. Students can work by themselves or as teams to try and figure out the answer."
 It took teachers into the age of technology with students
 Makes learning kids fun for kids. Lots of games can be used.
" Kahoot is versatile. It can be used on computers, ipads, even smart devices. I have made my own Kahoot reviews and quizzes and I've also used some of the many that are posted on the site. It is easy to use. The students are completerly engaged when we use kahoot. I like to use them as a review for units of study, but they could also be used as assessments. The kids feel like we're on a game show."
 The ease of Kahoots drew me in but the excitement factor is a winner with kids.
" I like that I can quickly create a game to review for math on the same morning I want to use it; it is that quick and easy to use. Also, I can tailor it EXACTLY to what I want my students to focus on."
" I like that I can create and customize interactive quizzes and practice for my students. Also, it is easy to find quizzes that are already created on the same topic and edit those to fit my needs."
" I love that I can create my own quizzes or search for quizzes made by other users. This site gives instant feedback for student understanding and kids have a lot of fun. They love that they get more points for getting a question correct, and it brings out their competitiveness."
 I really enjoy using Kahoot! as a way to allow my students to review before tests. I also like to use it after reading chapters or sections in social studies. I am looking forward to using Jumble next week as I have not gotten to test that out with my students yet.
" Easy, fun, interactive platform that students love. Great competitive tool that motivates students to do their best against each other."
It's works perfectly and meeting all our needs hence no fault. Rational DOORS makes it easy for everyone in our organisation and beyond to participate in and contribute to the requirements management process in a number of formats.
Needs more configurable options. Lacks simplicity. Theres nothing to dislike about Google drive Very dis organised as features are not arranged according to priority of usage. I love this application because it allows me to attend online meetings with multiple workers in a simple and safe way.
"Best of all, its free It has an amazing long and support lifespan, and great compatibility and support It is backed up by a professional ream at RedHat and it has a high lifespan. It is easy to install and solid They have a very dedicated team for customer success alone. Must appreciate this business idea. Its really useful that we get to read a lot of reviews. They somehow find the right note to play at the right time. I would like an intermediate solution between the 4 users and 5 or more users. The price difference is significant. Also a cloud solution would be excellent."
The option to share files and the synchronization with the computer.
What I like the most is that you can track many things at the same time for the benefit of the clients and be aware of their tastes. The interface is sometimes a little difficult to get used to new users who have no experience with this type of tools my group has received a few calls that are unsure of how to perform basic searches and we had to take the time to explain it in detail It is something that could be fixed. Has great features.payments and payrolls has greatly improved.I spent a lot of time with Quickbooks while doing my accouting activities but with wave i use less time.It is greatful for small business. I've experienced a few issues in the past that have affected business however these are quickly resolved by the support team.
It is free as long as you dont make calls to actual landlines.It has instant messaging tool that is significant and perfect for document collaboration.It allows one to make both audio and video conferencing with personal and business contacts.
"Very useful for us since we require multiple formats in our work, mainly PDF and sometimes it is a waste of time not being able to find a software with which you can do this fast, thanks to EasyPDF now only in minutes can we have this task completed"
"I like the remote feature of Microsoft office it boosts up the productivity. As this works on cloud based system so we can access our files everywhere. It comes with a very clean user interface which also helps in the productivity. al principio de su uso te encontrarás con una pequeña curva de aprendizaje en el uso de Business Wire, pero una vez que lo aprendes y lo practicas, no tienes que preocuparte por problemas o errores. Es impecable y excelente en ese sentido."
not effective in emergency cases require network connection in case its poor in leads to poor healthcare
" What I didn't like about this software is that the prices can be exaggerated for being a questionnaire program, they should offer more plans or discounts so they could acquire more clients. The location of all their means of work, becoming really impotent giving you know the person who works with the software work, but has made incursion into it"
" It's a sort of innovation that you have to learn and set up first. From that point onward, it's filling in as apparatus enlivened. Obviously, it needs improvement, however an extraordinary piece of the work you need to do toward the start."
" Updates are very frequent and are bulky, so slow internet may ruin the experience of enjoyment using this code development IDE. Download Size is huge and good internet connection is needed to download it. I like to use it simplifies my work and speeds me up in the performance of my practices.I particularly love Outlook"
 There are gaps in the design of login. Record disaggregated and not condensed. I particularly appreciate that this website should be better if it is given some features that lead to a better design of its platform.
" Patient support may take quite long to respond. premium account tariffs are very expensive , cost should been lesser I don't have any dislikes at this current time. I love that Expensify is incredibly easy to use , and can be used from virtually anywhere. I enjoy the capability to snap receipts with smartphones and queue them for reimbursements which makes accounting a breeze. I would say it kind of cost effective provided the services it offers from helping organisations recruit best candidates for jobs.allows users to post to job boardsworks well for users looking for jobs as it can prepare you for what is most looked for by recruiters I love it so much that HubSpot can join with another program like Slack, SaasOptics and Gmail. The synchronized data between software are very good and really productive, necessary and useful. I also use HubSpot to pursue the development and account updates that are very easy to use."
" Psiphon is such an excellent application that I have nothing bad to say about it. Thanks to this founding organization in the countries where we have blocks of all kinds, we can continue in communication and contact."
" There are not a lot of disadvantages of this editor. Default themes could be added to make it more UI friendly. Formatting should be built in, not in plugin as it is a regularly used in programming or at least I use it regularly. Best application, although it requires internet connection to work.Searching functionality could be improved. Medical office online is easily navigable, easy to learn, 100% paperless and totally online, which makes it readily available to users anywhere in the world. It is HIPAA compliant. It is pretty secure.It's backup systems are promising, and it's easily synchronized with your devices. Linked have been helpful with applying for job thus nothing to complain about."
" zoom is one of the best screen sharing.This software enables direct sharing of files from an android device.The software contacts available status and is one of the best video sharing. The idea of a distributed repository unlike SVN attracts the most. Easy to use via plugins in Eclipse IDE. GUI is user friendly. Approve commits feature is popular and helps in maintaining stable code base. work requests, work orders, inventory of purchases and purchases and more"
" weebly offer great tools for website building for developing having little exposure of the field. The drag and drop feature is quite helpful. It has a lot of customizable themes which are one the best in the market.It also allows the user to edit using html or CSS. Lo que menos me gusta es que tengo que eliminar los efectos de mis presentaciones y se ve muy estático en un archivo PDF, pero es algo más que una forma de ejecutar la herramienta. Del resto no tengo comentarios negativos. I love how deeply integrated the workflow environment is, and the user interface is highly intuitive. You can get any coins sent to trust wallet plus it has its own browser built into app Sometimes you get dissapointing decisions from their part."
" I love the collaborative idea of putting varied forms of content and users in one place. It can be inspirational and fun. easy-to-use preventive maintenance tool, simple with multiple functionality, for the maintenance of my company's facilities Disadvantages - The cost of implementation, in some cases exceeds widely anticipated initially. I really like the efficiency of zabbix in monitoring all our customers' internet circuits."
 I have nothing negative against the dropbox business it is very good.
" For the users who are not affiliated to the plan mas costly they must be necessarily connected to an Internet network to be able to enjoy the service what can be the bounding one at the moment of doing the presentations I love Azure because it has a totally free and customizable guide of recommendations on how to implement azure, it is also a good optimizer with guaranteed security Slow support but they are perfect when they respond."
" Free trial period requires registration on iPushPull website Typically when I’m testing out new software, I’m contacted by a sales rep or support staff to see if I have any questions or need tutorials, etc. I’ve been using this product for over a month and haven’t been contacted. Easy and quick solutions to problems for someone familiar with mathematical expression. We can use any mathematical equation we know."
 ANIMATIONS EFFECTS THT KEEP ON REDUCING THE SPEED OF PAGES EDIT + is the best editing tool we have around. Its usage cannot be over emphasized as an IT exectutive.

Reliable with job postings.Easy to create a account and a build a profile which help to get jobs.Applying the job is easy through the website.Its helps the users to add experieences and skills. I think its the best DAW out there because of its versatility. My favorite thing about it its how easy and intuitive you can edit audio."
Ensure you have some experience of prior systems that have similar capabilities as we've had issues where people have driven up cost and difficulty due to the fact that they do not have the right experience and have caused more problems within the system than they would in an easier-to-learn tool.
"Puede querer ser un poco arriesgado como todos los demás. Toma algunas búsquedas en el camino para ver las solicitudes de localhost. Sin embargo, tuve que leer a través de varios tutoriales para comprender todo lo que debería hacer y la forma de hacerlo. No muy amigable para el consumidor novato. Toma memoria RAM adicional de lo contrario No es muy eficiente Ahora no pasé por alto algo relacionado con este conector, hasta ahora no tuvimos problemas para aplicarlo No es muy verde. No es muy escalable por mi parte Muchas veces es muy lenta de cargar y esto es muy molesto."
"So far the bit negative viewpoint we can consider are their costs, since these are expanding as per the requirements of your organization, the more managers you need the more it cost."
"The ease of setting up users and transferring leads back and forth along with the exporting reports makes this a great interface. Zoho CRM has a nice database for storing all the contact details of my prospects, clients and referral partners. It allows me to add notes and organize my contacts. We can easily install and use Adobe reader mobile. We can easily manage PDF documents using this as read, edit PDF documents. we can Easly read pdf documents using mobile that help easy to work with PDF documents."
It could be more user-friendly in terms of a better GUI. At times tests fails because of non-reliability of objects.
"The software sometimes crashes when I have too many VMs running at the same time, but it does not crash often. The app just hangs and does not open It stays at the splash screen. Doesn't even goes to the meeting that is one of the things i do dislike from this app The only limitation with slack is that the free version has limited functionalities PERFECT STEPS TO USE WITH A GREAT SUPPOR I WAS ABLE TO USE IT"
"Although drag n drop is a great tool to build the website it still lack some features as compared to its competitors. If the developer decide to migrate to another software then Migration to any other platform once the site is fully functional is quite cumbersome and difficult. it is very easy to use. It can get the job done in less time than before. It has also made the complicated job extremely simple. You can manage multiple sub brands under one log in and it provides a true team environment where everyone chips in to make both each other and company better When accessing the software from a remote location where the internet connection is poor, file upload/download is affected."
 MessagePath covers all. It is one of the best AI writing assistants I have ever used. There is nothing to criticize. I honestly wish I had started using it long before now.
" As the only negative point that can have google earth pro, it may be that some maps that are little consulted do not bother to update them, so it can be a bit annoying to consult rural areas of countries like Spain"
" The ability to transcribe and record when a video call is made, its flexibility and ease of entry and development, its interface and the quality of image projection when making a call. You can sign in and use slack from a web browser on your desktop or through the mobile app at any time."

 The number of times I have used Elementor is really much and I have not encountered any of its setbacks. I think it has none.
 I don't have any dislikes at this current time.

" Smaller footprint than full blown SQL, easier to administer as it doesn't have all the bells and whistles."
" What I like most about this cloud storage software is the availability of features that make it easy for my company to sync,share and collaborate on documents.

" Esteem and supportiveness, they complete a damn great job. it is exceptionally useful as it goes to a n simple method for making clients select or comprehend about things which is required."
" work requests, work orders, inventory of purchases and purchases and more The whole system is the best but it has got a few drabacks that i don't like about it, it is a bit slower compared to other softwares and also installing it is pretty expensive. I would be fascinated that the service to the consumer is totally available to solve the worries live and I would love it to improve its loading speed quickly so that it can convert the best."
 if you have to ever dig manually through logs to try to find something it can be a little overwhelming. The user interface could use some workI would like the ability to create more customizable dashboards.The way log streams are used feels very counterintuitive.
 I dislike all the things you have to download yourself I wish it was all built in before you download the wallet ServageOne may be a low-cost in addition as versatile platform that is very helpful and includes a quick setup that makes this tool additional accessible to the users. A very slow incident response can be very dangerous because it gives intuders the time they need to steal proprietary data and destroy infrastructure.

It has relevant functions of the audio service, such as monitor events, interpretations in foreign languages, recording, playback. Q and A, and discharge choices. It is one of the most perfect tools for conference computers."
" No he tenido inconveniente alguno durante el uso de esta plataforma, todo lo contrario lo que he logrado es positivo."
 So cool and easy to use.Nice interface and great with project management.I love it's effeciency for teamwork too much UI may add overhead to users development phase.

 Theres nothing to dislike about Google drive
"b & v staffinges a tools very easy to use, is an agency specializing in staffing and recruitment, permanent staff or contract, the delivery of staff is immediate within the time I request"
"With Act programming, you can't see portion bits of knowledge in regards to each record and resolve past due sales. It is hard to do customer orders objectives with that. Furthermore Act could be moderate and you can just investigate from 1 to 1 account and can't treat different records meanwhile. The solution is quite expensive for small businesses."
"En los momentos actuales en el uso de esta herramienta, he visto la creatividad que puedo ejercer con respecto a los métodos que comúnmente hago.

There is a learning curve if the user hasn’t used a project management software before. Perfectly integrated software for video calls with live chat availability, what I like most about Customerly is that I can have a chat path with the customer for technical assistance. I mostly like the way this software investigates the endpoint by pushing the collection tool over the network, collecting relevant data and analyzing it for malware and suspicious activity."
I like it because it's easy and simple to use
I have a no any dislike about the Dropbox because it is very useful software to store
" Having different instances of the same project makes it easier for the dev team to fix multiple bugs separately. If same team or member is working on different projects, different channels with different projects allow ease for comparision. Its a new software but it has has proven to be best in data analysis. I surely dont like anything concerning this brilliant software. There's not much I dislike as they are constantly listening to the field and updating their system to support our needs."
" you must have a good connection to the internet, because if your connection is scant, the videos are probably not as defined anche se ci dovessero essere dei limiti al programma possono essere superati grazie alla esecuzione degli script associati ad ogni evento."

When we needed to refresh our charge card on record, I discovered that nothing has changed.

The chat isn't great, we use another software for that though, so that's not a real problem for us. user has a lot of templates to choose from and additional advantage in this software is that it allows the user to upload their own templates which is quite handy and useful.

" users having Mac and MacOS server can setup this software in just a few steps. For those users who have paid for the apple developer account, this software is free for them. The Xcode Bots are directly integrated into the real Xcode. Xcode server is best suitable for small iOs teams."
 it seems pretty good especially because it allows me the superficiality of the emails and the filtering of them
" The license must be paid according to each characteristic in addition to being married to a single SO, which seems a little disadvantageous."
 The LiveAgent does not support the messages archiving which i guess the team should work on.
"Kahoot is so interactive and easy to use. It takes time to build your own and select all of the multiple choice options, adding graphics if you want... OR you can search for a pre-existing one or have the students make and share- just make sure you REVIEW & EDIT every answer before letting the class play. Kahoot provides standard music and graphics if you do not want to upload your own."
"Kahoot! is simple to use, and a great, engaging assessment tool. Students love playing and there are THOUSANDS of public quizzes already created that you can easily accommodate for your needs. It can be used as a quick, informal assessment to let you see where your kids are, and they love the competition style format. I often reward the winners with late work passes, etc. as an added bonus."
Kahoot keeps students engaged at higher rates for longer times.
Simple Social and engaging. Kids love it and have a great time while learning
I love that Kahoot is an interactive way to review with the whole class while still giving each student an idea of their individual progress. My students love Kahoot because they get to review but it is also a competition between themselves and their classmates. They also really enjoy the ghost mode where they get to compete against themselves as well. It also is nice because all the students need in order to participate they only need a device so it is very easy to use kahoot in class as a quick review since you don't need to spend time gathering supplies or handing things out.
"I like that Kahoot makes students feel like they are involved in a game show. The music makes them feel excited and engaged in the topic. Also, students like that after each question it shows them were they are in their ranking against the rest of the class. This feeds on their competitive natures and encourages them to put forth more effort into their answers on the quiz. If they know what a Kahoot quiz is coming up than they will study beforehand for the quiz so that they can beat their teammates and win whatever prize I am offering."
Kahoot does a great job at providing a fun environment for a short quiz. It is very engaging and most students enjoy participating. You can also use many pre-made quizzes on topics that other people have made.
"I like that kahoot give you the option to create your own games, have students work individually or in teams and ultimately have fun while learning."
"It's a small, but very important details: I really appreciate that the answer choice selection buttons are a combination of colors and shapes! I'm very cognizant of various learning disabilities, and combining colors and shapes really helps reach a larger portion of my students as they ""play"" Kahoot. The other thing I really like is the concept itself: Kahoot allows me to assess learning and check progress, while students think it's tons of fun!"
" The best part about Kahoot is the sheer simplicity of it. Kahoot is a website that allows teachers to set up a quiz, survey or discussion and gather results from students electronically. Students access the Kahoot on any device with an internet connection. The teacher can choose the amount of time for each question. After each question, the Leaderboard is shown with the top students. (Points are based on speed and accuracy)."
" Another great feature of Kahoot is the Kahoot Community. Instead of creating a Kahoot from scratch, a teacher can browse the community of thousands of public Kahoots on a variety of topics. You can also customize other users Kahoots if you'd like to add or remove questions. Kahoot also allows you to export the results, which is great for teachers to analyze student data."
 You get feedback for students on each question. You can make your ka hoot public so other people can use it as well.
 I loved using Kahoot with the class I was in. The students were able to review pertinent information for the subject they were learning and have fun with a live competition at the same time.
 Kahoot is a great resource to use as a teacher because the students love competing against their peers to show who knows more about the information that has been taught to them throughout any given unit or lesson.
" I love how the game is designed and easy to use. It allows for quick setup! You can personalize your background and it is really easy format to enter in your questions. After that, you play Kahoot!"
 The students at school LOVE playing games on Kahoot! It is really interactive & fun! It is a great tool for whole-class collaborative learning!
 I love how it gets kids engaged and having fun while learning
 Engaging. The ghost mode that allows students to play themselves or their class without using their name. Excellent way to add fresh twists to typical class room formative assessments.
 I love that turns quizzes into games and motivates my students.
