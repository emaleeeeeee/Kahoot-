"My students and I love Kahoot! I love the ability to create my own games which we can use to review content or even to pre-assess new content. The fact that the mobile option was added during Covid-19 made the site even sweeter. Teachers can now assign a game and put a start and end time. After that, students who can see who won. This really allows everyone to stay connected even when they are not together."
"As a fifth grade teacher, I also love the availability of games that were not made by me but are still applicable. If we have extra time, I can load a game on a relevant topic and we are ready to play within only a couple of minutes."
Many students thrive on competitiveness and this allows them to give their all.
"Students get excited to use this, and that's the best thing about it. Students actually request we use it in class when reviewing content and vocabulary. It's easy to use as a teacher."
"When in terms of online games ,i really prefer this online app, it's easy to search, easy to learn, easy to understand the game mechanics, it gives adrenaline to the participants, another source of bonding with colleagues, another source of fun and games. I"
This can play with so many players.
Simple to use format makes it easy for me to quickly and efficiently create engaging quizzes for my class. The students are able to play the quizzes as if it's a game and I find that material is retained better.
 I like the online quiz functionality. My colleagues and I have been forced to work remotely the last few months due to lockdowns. We use Kahoot weekly to play fun games together in company wide meetings for prizes. It's a great way to bond with coworkers when working remotely. The quizes are fun and the way they calculate the score is based off if your answer is correct and the time it took you to answer. These games can get very competitive when prizes are on the line!
 The interface is very user friendly that anyone could figure it out instantly. The way to connect to a game online is also very simple. I like everything about Kahoot!
" My favorite thing about Kahoot is that my students think it is a game and not an assessment or learning tool. Any time I use a Kahoot as a formative assessment at the end of a lesson, my students are excited to play, even at times that they may not have enjoyed the lesson content. In addition, Kahoot offers tools to review your students answers post-game and to break down which questions may need to be covered again before a quiz or test."
" I love that Kahoot! has an app to help facilitate participation in live quizzes and games. We're all on our phones anyway, so it's a great way to feel like you are playing a game. I also love that there is the option to create your own quizzes, or use premade quizzes (a holiday quiz, for example)."
" Kahoot is a great way to bring up the energy level in a classroom or even corporate setting. The platform is based on selecting multiple choice answers from a given question, and the faster the correct answer is chosen, the more points that are give to the participant. After each question, a leaderboard is shown. Kahoot quizzes are made by many contributors, many of which are public and can be played and assigned by anyone, or can be duplicated and edited. Even the ""waiting room"" music is fun. Personally, the smooth and professional design is what seals the deal in my book. It makes it look intriguing and not at all clunky for students."
" Kahoot provides a very interactive and engaging platform where people can learn through games. Schools, universities, and many other organizations use it to conduct online quizzes and many other fun activities through which students and employees can learn and understand new things. Kahoot is vey easy to use and even a first tim user can easilynavigate through the website."
" The engagement factor and how it is adaptable inside the classroom. Students seem to love this program. Great for educational use as learning becomes a game, and friendly competition among students pushes them to understand what the teacher is teaching. I think the ability to add images and Youtube videos to the Kahoots adds even more to the interactivity of the platform. And I love having students create their own games and share those with the class."
 Kahoot allows to generate small quizes that can be used for multiple objectives like just having fun with it by creating competetions and small presentations just to keep everyone entertained in these tough times or it can also be used to have some serious question where the opinion of everyone is required and some decisions are to be made based on that.
" The easy way to organize quizzes or games in activities like training, seminars, or webinars using the individual devices of the participants like mobile phones, tablets, or laptops. Using this software, the collecting of answers is easy, and get the score of each player and quickly determine who the winner is, mainly if there are many partcipants. It's a fun way to have this kind of software in games or quizzes at this time that everything is almost online. As a participant, I can make my nickname of whatever I want."
" The best thing about Kahoot is how it engages the students. They answer questions and can see what their peers are answering. Additionally, they compete with each other but in a way that is friendly. The students are then motivated and engaged in the class content. Other teachers also have created Kahoots that I can publically view and adapt to my class' lessons, which makes it a little bit easier for a teacher to put something together a lot more quickly. The pace can be adjusted to support students' needs."
" The thing I like the most about Kahoot is that it is a fun way to check for my student's understanding of concepts; they get excited to play Kahoot when in actuality, it is actually a test that gives me great information as to what concepts are being mastered and what we still need to work on."
 Student engagement. The questions can be assigned so anyone can play at anytime. People are competive and trivia is a fun game.
 Students and staff get into the Khoots.

 My students absolutely love Kahoot! It keeps them engaged and keeps review fun and active. Everyday they ask to play. I love how simple it is to set up and project on a screen.
" The best thing about Kahoot is that it is a formative assessment that allows me to monitor student understanding of a topic as I teach it, but my students think of it as a game. Because of this, they all participate to the best of their ability and give me the most accurate representation of their understanding."
" I love that you can quickly search their database for created games that align with the topic you need. While it is easy to create your own game, it is time-saving if you can find one already created."
" I love how Kahoot allows all of my students to interact with class materials. Since they now all have laptops or tablets, it is easy for them to get on Kahoot and play the games that I create or find for them. Kahoot is one of my favorite ways for them to study or review materials, as well as to see what they know before we start different topics."
 Kahoot is a very fun way to engage students as they review material. The previously made ones on the Kahoot! Discover page are such a great resource for teachers in a hurry. It also lets you have in-person and virtual people participate. I like that you can pause the game to have time to cover questions that students may have struggled with. It also saves a report of each student's progress which is really helpful to communicate with parents. I use it when a student is not particpating and a parent feels concerned about their progress. It is a good way to have evidence for in class behaviors.
" Kahoot is great it helps in organizing quizzes with ease and the innovative way in which the only user has to select q answer makes it very convenient to use, Kahoot has multiple uses from friendly competitions among colleagues to using it to create just a fun quiz and know everyone's perspective towards something. Kahoot has a new way of organizing the quizzes and since its browser bases, it doesn't need any download which makes it more convenient to use."
 What I like the most about Kahoot! is how engaging and fun it is to both host and play a kahoot.
" I like how easy it is to create a kahoot from zero, and the platform is very intuitive and user-friendly."
 I also enjoy a lot the mobile app in which I can save all my reports from past kahoots and play them to unlock emoticons and so on.
" Overall, Kahoot is a great platform to host quizzes, and I could easily recommend it to anyone."
" Being live and interactive quiz platform, it has a great UI and gives an excellent experience. Its easy to use and in most cases, it just needs and the Game pin to join and takes only seconds."

"During the Kahoot! Pro free trial, it was great to use the online survey mechanic for a group presentation. However, I soon realised I could have achieved what I wanted with the free account version, but despite it wasn't able to get a refund. Do not subscribe for the week trial!"
It is easy to use but always surprises and creates fun for the people participating
"I love how awesome, fun and interesting Kahoot makes learning. My students and I love using Kahoot to review grammar topics and vocabulary seen in class, we also use it to review history and geography. It's an interactive platform and it allows me to see live progress in my students, plus I love that it allows me to download the score and keep it as a record."
"The fact that Kahoot is such a fun game. Where you can attract more people who's part of your meeting let's say engage with you. You can also add some twist there like using your screen name to make the fun more exciting. Also using the Kahoot is convenient since you can not just access it to your web browser but to your mobile phone at any time, as long as you have the code in joining the Kahoot you and your other colleague can enjoy it together!"
"I like the funky interface, option to customise quizzes with music and background images. It gives multiple choice, true/false, option to give each question different weightage and availability on mobile phone for easy access. While pluing keep the audience enagged because of the scoreboard appearing after every answer."

" Learning has finally gotten fun! In this challenging game of only four options per question, the student's job is to pick the correct answer in the lowest amount of time. The students have fun, the teacher has a new learning tool and parents are seeing their students succeed in the overall academic studies. I can easily create Kahoots using designated templates or to create my own straight from scratch. When I don't have any ideas on how to create a Kahoot, I could simply search for one another teacher has created that directly correlates with the subject I am teaching on hand."
" Fun for the kids! They love the competitiveness of the game, and often forget they are learning!"
 I love that I can quickly assess how well the students understood information.

There is virtually no learning curve and the students seem to catch on to how the website / app works almost immediately. I use it for reviewing content that we cover in class and making the content more fun and interactive by including images and trick answer choices. Kahoot! offers a lot of features, even on their free plan, that make creating a game fun and interactive. You can set specific time limits for questions, add images or video clips to make the questions more dynamic, and of course you have complete control over which answers you mark as correct. It does all of the work scoring the game itself and at the very end it shows the top three players. It also has a scoreboard that updates as you play the game to keep everyone interested and up to date on who is scoring the most."
" I really like Kahoot's point system, which tallies correct responses and the speed of responses to calcuate a score for each user. It's an exciting and competitive game, and brings a lot of fun into quizzing. This software is perfect as a fun way to test participant's knowledge, especially after a training or educational event.

Great study tool for groups and in the classroom
How excited the students are when we play Kahoot to review a quiz. Students who do answer wrong are okay with the results. It is such a fun learning atmosphere that they feel safe enough to share their answers. My students beg for Kahoot!
"It gets the kids learning but in a fun manner. Regular classroom time can be boring, so having a fun game that is still educational that i can make is useful."
I absolutely love kahoot for ease of use and platform. Kahoot makes it very easy to create a multiple-choice style game for learning. The game works for students of all ages- children and adults!
I really enjoy using this project with my RA’s!
That everyone can individually play with a phone or tablet!
"it is intuitive but risky, Do not rely on it if You organize an official event/training as this solution is not maintained properly and You do not want to rely on the live solution which can be disappointing."

Great study technique to do in class
Very interactive and allows for students to apply what they learn
"Kahoot is a fast way to hook your students and grab their attention. I use kahoot to introduce a new topic, practice a new concept, and review for a test. Kahoot offers more than just quizzes, they allow students to stop and think about a question or discussion point which is a great way to change up a lesson plan. Students can work by themselves or as teams to try and figure out the answer."
It took teachers into the age of technology with students
Makes learning kids fun for kids. Lots of games can be used.
"Kahoot is versatile. It can be used on computers, ipads, even smart devices. I have made my own Kahoot reviews and quizzes and I've also used some of the many that are posted on the site. It is easy to use. The students are completerly engaged when we use kahoot. I like to use them as a review for units of study, but they could also be used as assessments. The kids feel like we're on a game show."
The ease of Kahoots drew me in but the excitement factor is a winner with kids.
"I like that I can quickly create a game to review for math on the same morning I want to use it; it is that quick and easy to use. Also, I can tailor it EXACTLY to what I want my students to focus on."

"Easy, fun, interactive platform that students love. Great competitive tool that motivates students to do their best against each other."
Kahoot! Is an engaging way to keep students excited about the classroom. They have added new features over time to keep changing it up. I love team mode which allows students to collaborate together while completing a task.
Kahoot offers a fun way for my students to interact with the material I am trying to teach them. It offers a game like interaction. It is also very user friendly and has easy to follow text boxes that you just need to fill out. My students are always engaged when we use this as a way test if they learned the material. We use this in classes and during trainings.
"Good interactive game that gets almost all kids engaged. I like that I can alter the amount of time allowed for each question, as well as add pictures or diagrams to the questions. The scorekeeping keeps the kids interested and trying to get the right answers."
Students love the “game” aspect of the program. I’ve even had some ask for the link so they can play again on their own time.
"I like that I can create my own questions or search for someone else's already made Kahoot. I like that Kahoot stores my students' results so that I can analyze who got what right. I also give students a grade on their Kahoot performance, either based on the overall score or on which questions they got right/wrong. Also, it's free."
It is an easy way to work interactive with our students. It is motivating them and can be accessed everywhere.
Ease of use for both creator and student

I LOVE Kahoot and so do my students. I really like that they have added additional features this year such as Jumble. Jumble is great for Social Studies and anything that involves order.

Best of all - it's free and there are so many resources created for you. You can find so many resources based on any content and edit them as you see fit for your classroom.

It is great for fun icebreakers in meetings at work. I also use it for my students in my SI Sessions when I quiz them before the exams. It is very versatile when it comes to use."
I like that it gives students time to read the question and pick the correct answer. You are also able to have multiple choice questions to up the 4 answers. I also like how you are able to set it so that there is a possibility of having two correct answers.
"The students get really excited. I use Kahoot from 6th grade through college students. All of them name kahoot as a highlight of my lessons. If I put the same material on a multiple choice quiz they would complain but with Kahoot its a game. The music adds to the excitement. It's great for trick questions followed by a discussion of what they missed. for rote learning, ghost mode is great and the kids get really into beating their old score."
"I love how Kahoot ""game-ifies"" the idea of review. Definitely don't use it to introduce topics, but the interface it presents for fast paced multiple choice questions is great. The students love it and I see students who aren't typically engaged suddenly asking if they can borrow notes from another student so that they can reference them to get questions right. Love it!"
Students love the interactive nature of this program and enjoy competing for the highest score
The students LOVE it. What was once boring--a quiz or review--is now exciting! Students look forward to doing kahoots and get excited whenever they hear that music play. It's pretty easy to set up a quiz and to play it or share it with other instructors.
"Kahoot makes the everyday question asking and presentation fun! It is a way to get your audience engaged that brings energy and excitement to the room! Kahoot is always a most loved part of presentations when I read surveys from attendees. It has completely changed the way I do public speaking, presentations, and workshops."
Simple and interesting application which has a lot of features to create games for students. And In my view best method to keep students attention to lesson is play a game about it. I love it.

"I love that this is an interactive game that allow teachers to bring technology into the classroom. I love how easy it is to create questions, decide which type of answer choices you want to use and then an easy access code for students to play with."

"I like that Kahoot is free, easy to manipulate for the instructors who use it, has a friendly user-interface, and is easily accessible from student phones even if they don't bring their laptop to class. The students like that it is portable and that they can have interactive practice questions to prepare for their nursing boards."
Creates a fun environment for learning. Great to use at corporate events to see what people have retained from a meeting or what they know coming into an event. Also great for surveys. The system is free!! It has amazing reports that are generated following use. Provides detailed feedback that lives in the system so you can compare users over time! They also offer a relatively cheap version that allows for extended options.
It is a fun multiple choice quiz game tool. I’ve used it many times with my students and they love it! It is easy to search for created quizzes.

I like the availability of quizzes and games made by someone else (no need to re invent the wheel) and also the option to create my own content.
I like that it gives students time to read the question and pick the correct answer. You are also able to have multiple choice questions to up the 4 answers. I also like how you are able to set it so that there is a possibility of having two correct answers. It makes my job really easy for personality development quizzes.
"My students love it! My kids cheer when I tell them we are going to play this game. You can also play the same Kahoot more than once in ""Ghost mode"", where the kids can go up against their ghosts (previous scores). The Kahoots are relatively easy to create and there are tons of games made by other users that you can search and use as well."
I absolutely LOVE using Kahoot in my classroom. My students love being able to test their knowledge and compete against each other to see who knows the most.
This is a fun and easy tool for participation amongst youth and adults in meetings and workshops.

It creates a game format that facilitates a healthy learning climate with user interaction even in the adult learning space.
Good for thinking after mulling over a case in the medical setting
Promotes student engagement

I loved this product in my previous classroom experience. We used this software to create questions for students to test their knowledge and re-learn what they didn't know. It was so much fun . .they wanted to learn!
Kahoot is a website that makes learning fun and interactive for students.
"Kahoot is wonderful tool for reviewing multiple-choice questions. It incites competition with its fast pace, fun music and bright colors. There are other options as well, such as a jumble and a survey, but I mostly use it to review multiple-choice questions. Students are held accountable because they can see their standing in the point total, and they achieve points for getting the answer right, for clicking quickly on the right answer, and for getting a number of right answers in a row. The time given to answer questions can be changed, and whether or not bonus points are given for each correct answer can also be changed."

I love that Kahoot is an interactive way to review with the whole class while still giving each student an idea of their individual progress.

They also really enjoy the ghost mode where they get to compete against themselves as well. It also is nice because all the students need in order to participate they only need a device so it is very easy to use kahoot in class as a quick review since you don't need to spend time gathering supplies or handing things out.
"I like that Kahoot makes students feel like they are involved in a game show. The music makes them feel excited and engaged in the topic. Also, students like that after each question it shows them were they are in their ranking against the rest of the class. This feeds on their competitive natures and encourages them to put forth more effort into their answers on the quiz. If they know what a Kahoot quiz is coming up than they will study beforehand for the quiz so that they can beat their teammates and win whatever prize I am offering."
