BAD REVIEW
Can be difficult to track down what student goes with what nickname. Students say that sometimes it glitches and chooses an answer for them.
"The one downside is when a student performs poorly, it can be difficult for them to catch up with points. Low-performing students can get frustrated when they realize they numerically can't win and will shut down. It'd be helpful if there were a mechanism in place to confront this issue."
The subscription for a kahoot over 10 players is somewhat expensive. Most classrooms have more than ten students. I ended up purchasing a subscription but I wish it cost a little less.
Nothing comes to mind! The base functionality works great. I wish Kahoot would branch out more into other online games. I am sure that is on their future roadmap.
"The only thing I dislike about Kahoot is that when you're making a custom quiz, images are no longer available from the free version. You can still use GIFs, which work just as well, but I don't know why the developers would remove the images."
There isn't much that I dislike about this software. It's a great way to encourage live engagement in meetings.
"Once Kahoot came out with more than the free, basic platform, it was apparent that they had very much improved the features (audio questions, typed answers). This is very nice and could be useful for remote learning, but unfortunately it is not free. The only complaint is that the text does not allow for math typeface, but it is fairly simple to insert a jpeg image with any math problem shown in the question area."
"I also don't enjoy that the platform sometimes causes students some anxiety since the questions are speed-based and timed. However, the administrator of the Kahoot has the ability to adjust the time limits."
 There is nothing to dislike about the software. The only thing Kahoot can do is maybe improve their server size as sometimes the page gets refresh on its own or the options are not visible during quizzes.
" Not much honestly. I think Kahoot does everything they set out to do. They have enhanced student data tracking to see past results and statistics. It has changed quite a lot since its beginning, so the look and feel is totally different and will require relearning of the site."
" The only thing kahoot lacks is in terms of convinience, it is a great idea but usually due to some problem or other kahoot faces a minor lag and this results in out of sync questions and answers that takes away all the fun and makes it a lot more frustrating rather than interesting."
" Since every participant can make their nicknames, there were times the winners could not recognize them. Hopeful, there is a way to identify the winner in another legitimate way while using the preferred nickname."
" The only thing that I dislike is the lack of features in the free version. On top of that, they need to be a bit more transparent about their data collection on students. If it could, Kahoot would really benefit from a service that reads the questions aloud in multiple languages. If the question is in English, it would be nice if it read in English. If in German (for example in my classroom), it would be nice if it was read in German."
" Something I dislike about Kahoot is that it is entirely reliant on technology; if a student doesn't have a laptop or device because they left it at home or it isn't charged, then they cannot participate."
 Limited number of characters when creating questions and answers. Remotely any set with over 100 questions will crash.
 Sometimes boys join and then it's not fun.
" Kahoot has a lot of options for creating slides & polls, but their free trial doesn't allow you to explore those features, which is the only fact I dislike about Kahoot."
" Some of my students will cheat, waiting for other students to choose their answer. It might be beneficial to have an option to type in the answer, rather than choosing a shape. I also would like a better way to print and share results with students and parents."
" There's nothing that I dislike about Kahoot, but I would like if it included the ability to import questions from Quizlet or other similar programs."
" It is not as useful for math because of time limits and students working at their own pace, unless you make it an assignment and not a live game."
" Kahoot is so easy and fun to use that there is truly nothing I dislike about it. I used Kahoot and school, and now my students use it as well. I am a firm believer in Kahoot."
" I dislike that it is difficult to format math. I use a lot of symbols like square roots and other radicals and it becomes difficult to type. I also wish there was a better way to preview images. Sometimes, the images are too small to view like a graph of a function. Also, you have to be careful with the types of questions you choose. Since students earn more points based on their speed, they tend to rush rather than stop and think through the problem."
 The only single thing which I seem to dislike in Kahoot is that most of the time the live stream have a minor delay which is in milliseconds and usually unnoticeable but since Kahoot runs in realtime most of the time the option to select an answer pops up without any question on the screen which makes it hard to score more even when you know the answer.
" What I like the least about Kahoot! is the 10-player limit on the free version. I think this is a low number of players, even for the free version itself."
" I would like to see this number increased a little. If so, I would use Kahoot! more often."
" Not really any significant con, but I felt that having transparent analytics on standings of the students on the quiz to even the students will make it much more helpful."
" Not much is missing from this product. It can get disappointing when some students choose to make inappropriate names for themselves. However, the teachers are allowed to remove names/students which puts an end to that"
I wish it was easier to input pictures without upgrading
"You do have to pay for it in order to get the full experience and having a school or company account is the best way to get all the features, but that requires company approval and only a few people having access to the company/school account depending on the structure of the institution."
"I didn't want a full year subscription, and won't use it over the time period. I did not make the deadline since I had been misinformed about the upcoming apparent payment date which was the deadline to cancel the year-long Kahoot! subscription. I additionally thought in the worse case I'd end up paying for a month of Kahoot!, but had not been informed that it would result in a +$300AUD yearly subscription. I have so far not been able to get a refund."
"I think more training is needed when you need to set up advanced options. I have tried the paid version, and a lot of possibilities appear. However, it was too much for me to understand quickly"
"Nothing, Kahoot is amazing and I will definitely continue using it for my class."
"It needs data or wi-fi for everyone to able to access and use it. Kahoot needs to consider that some areas doesn't have a good internet connect, and considering countries who does not have any stable internet connection at all."
If i could speed up the interval time between leadership board and next question screens. It Takes too much unnecessary time to load for impatient minds like mine.
Students have to be able to see the teacher's screen as well. Teachers need to be sure to verify information on pre-made Kahoots to verify accuracy.
"Students learned how to ""hack"" the Kahoot somehow and generate numerous fake players/participants. Not sure how they do this...but it can be annoying."
 Some of the best features are only available with the paid version. This is difficult for poor teachers!
" Too many features are pay to play, too many tiers of membership, it gets expensive for a teacher to afford."
 I wish more people could join at one time with the free plan
 Sometimes the premade games aren't exactly what you need or want.
" The drastic change that this software uses in terms of innovation in its platform, can generate unpredictability and confusion among novice users who have just arrived at these facilities, this is due to the extreme implementation of multiple options for editing different angles of certain activity considered as some digital prototype, being a problem of delay, since its learning curve is literally somewhat steep."
" I dislike how there is a limit to only four options for each question. Sometimes, I need more than four to really confuse the student so that they can learn more in a shorter amount of time as they can differentiate from all of the selected options. I also think that a feature in which you could add more pictures to a question would be incredibly helpful as well."
" There is another program similar that lets you do the games at student pace, or as an assignments/quiz. Kahoot lacks some of these extra features."
 I dislike that each student does not have the answers on his or her screen. Sometimes it is hard for students to see the board with the answers. It would be better if the answers were on the individual devices also.
 I dislike that students cannot the see questions on their own screen. This had been particularly difficult during distance learning because students need to have two windows up at the same time.
" I do not know about you, but I can not seem to be able to log in. Whenever I try to, it says this user already has an account. So I go to log in, but when I log in, it says this user does not have an account. Log in or reset your password. Nothing works when I reset my password too."
" I wish that the premium features were included on the free plan, but that is my personal opinion. The premium plan is not very expensive and I could probably afford to get it myself without having to go through my school district because it really isn't that expensive, but I just see Kahoot! as a fun resource that should be 100% free for everyone."
" Some participants can become distracted by Kahoot's compatitive nature, so it is not alway appropriate for more serious topics or important use cases. Overall, the game is fun, especially for children and young adults, but for every day use it may prove to be a lot of work to create and administer quizzes with little reward."
" To that question frankly, there is not much to answer. Kahoot can annoy some people! Consequently, it is not always necessary to address more critical topics or important use cases. The game is usually fun, particularly for kids and young adults, but making and administering quizzes with little reward for the daily use can be a lot of effort."
"I have a top notch account and the main thing I don't care for is the absence of customization. I truly wish I could change the hues and give it a greater amount of our corporate marking. A few people in our group have disclosed to me that they don't care for how long the random data takes. Some state they want to do a test or something at their own pace. In any case, the vast majority truly prefer to go up against others and feel that the information remains with them when they are learning."
"Some people can be distracted by Kahoot! compatibility Consequently, more serious topics or significant use cases are not always appropriate. The game is generally fun, especially for children and young adults, but it can be a lot of effort to create and administer questionnaires with little reward for daily use. I wish that the premium features were included in the free plan. The premium scheme isn't very costly and I'd actually be able to do it myself without going through my school system because it isn't too costly, but I see kahoot! It should be 100% free as a fun tool for all."
Students have to see the projector to be able to play.
There are sometimes errors in the questions or answers. However they are very easy to fix by copying the Kahoot exercise and changing the question or answer as you please.
have to tell you what kind of question I want each time...........
"Regrettably, multiple questionnaire types can not be implemented in a presentation. Fast and stable Internet connection is also necessary, since any progress is eliminated in the event of an interruption because there is no automatic save option."
No feature for audio questions only. Video images detract from only providing audio.
Kahoot offers only a few types of quiz formats. It would be wonderful to see more formats created for Kahoot.
An intuitive Audience response systemthat unfortunately is not beneficial or useful in medical eduction. Not able to expand questions to board formats given the word limit for questions completely handicap the system.
" I have had a few people on our team tell me that they don't like how long the trivia takes. Some say they would rather take a quiz or something that goes at their own pace. However, the majority of the people on our sales team really like competing against others and they feel like the knowledge stays with them when they are learning."
 I don't like the reaction choices not showing on participant monitors; the manager may display and distribute the response choices. It makes it impossible for people with vision impairments to have. The accelerated function is often a deterrent to those with computing hardships; causing an unfairness amongst average learners and sluggish processors.
" When compiling a quiz, Kahoot misses some necessary features to make a complete diverse quiz. For example, you cannot ask specific questions, only multiple choice questions are available ."
 Nothing; my students love it. They esp. loved to compete among themselves.
" You need a wifi connection and everyone needs an electronic device. It may not always be the case in some schools/ classes. Also, if you want to add slides it's not possible except if you pay for it, it's a pity."
 I dislike that there is a three-tiered membership structure.
 Wish the Waiting page before the game starts can be customized a bit more.
" When assigning a game, the quiz is only available for a select amount of time."
 Copying pictures in the browser and directly being able to paste them into the Kahoot would make the life of teachers easier!
 I do not find it easy to copy questions from one quiz to another. I think that it is impossible.
 I also was trying to put a different time limit to answer but we can only choose the options Kahoot gives us.
" I very much dislike the need to write in every single possible answer in addition to each question. Compared to Quizlet or Gimkit, where they take answers from the rest of the deck and shuffle them, Kahoots are very tedious to create. They are also tedious to edit. The extra time needed to create a Kahoot means I use it very sparingly."
" Las opciones que nos ofrece kahoot en su versión gratuita son muy básicas, siendo la versión de pago la que mejores opciones para adaptarse a nuestros gustos ofrece, pero aún así el abanico es demasiado corto. Se echan en falta otras opciones, como por ejemplo poder crear test individiduales que no te hagan depender constantemente de la utilización de un cañón o proyector en clase."
" Muchas veces los alumnos se copian entre ellos, y sería mejor que los pudieran hacer de forma individual y con orden diferente para cada uno de ellos"
 that some quizzes come with errors. I have to play them all until the end to make sure that was not a misspelled word or an incorrect item.
 it can only be play form a tablet or phone.
 I wish it was easier to make my own game.
 There isn't anything that I dislike about this
 I can honestly say there was nothing I disliked
I do not like the lagging when streaming at times/music stops.
I have a premium account and the only thing I dislike is the lack of customization. I'd really like to be able to change colors and give it more of our corporate branding.
I do not like that the answer options do not appear on competitors' screens; only the administrator can see and broadcast answer options. This makes it difficult to use for those that are visually impaired. The timed feature also is a barrier to those with processing difficulties; which creates an inequity between typical learners and slow processors.
"There's nothing I don't like about it. Kahoot! is very fun, user friendly, easy and adaptable."
"The process of training and evaluating your own tests is time-consuming, so I don't regularly schedule them, so it would be fantastic if the business supplied more specific layouts. In addition, linking too many computers to one laptop could crash and delete all advancement."
"Unluckily, there's no option to implement various kinds of quizzes into one presentation, so you have to design separated slideshows to connect quizz + jumbo. Besides, there's no auto-save option, so in case of crashing the platform presentation is gone."
Lo peor de Kahoot es que el número de caracteres a incluir en las respuestas posibles a veces se queda demasiado pequeño.
"El precio no es caro, en su versión premium, pero tampoco es algo muy barato."
Se echa de menos poder subir un vídeo en las preguntas o una pista musical.
" Necesitas de conexión a internet para funcionar, además de un cañón proyector de luz para plasmar la pantalla con las pregutnas, y un dispositivo conectado a internet por cada alumno que quiera ser partícipe de la experiencia."
" An excellent facility is a repository with Kahoots created by other users, but there are few quizzes about sport, so I always have to create private ones. Besides, it requires a fast and stable internet connection, as in the case of interruption all the progress is deleted."
" The process of preparing and testing your own quizzes is time-consuming, so I don't prepare them frequently, so it would be excellent if the company provided more specified templates. Besides, connecting too many devices with one laptop, it might crash and all progress is deleted."
 Need to allow for more characters to typed within Kahoot when creating questions.
" I do not really have any particular dislikes, however, students do get bored with Kahoot if overused, maybe more game options could be offered."
" The pricing of kahoot is definitely on the higher end for the teachers. I think the visuals of the layout are a little too much all over the place for me, but it does the job!"
" The application happens to crash during my presentations, which is inconvenient, but luckily it runs after a few moments. Besides, sometimes quizzes from public repository include mistakes."
" Time-consuming is the method of generating and evaluating your own questionnaires. Therefore I don't regularly prepare them, so it would be great if developers supplied more specific templates. Further, linking too many computers to one device may crash and eliminate all improvements."
" I like pretty much everything about Kahoot, but one downside is the space for creating questions and answer responses is too small. I think there is a character limit for some responses and I would really like to have more space for my questions and answers."
 There isn't a whole lot that I dislike about kahoot. One thing I do dislike about kahoot is that the students can guess on the questions instead of trying. I also dislike that it is easy for the students to copy another students answer if they see their answer choice on their screen.
" While there are many distinct questions creation alternatives, sometimes I wish there was a way to adjust all the time settings at once instead of going separately through each issue."
 Sometimes the colors and shapes can get confusing. It is a neat program that works well for all kinds of students. People must download the program in order to play on their phone. Otherwise one must use their laptops to play. So there is some form of technology needed. But people can team up to play also.
 It is sometimes quite hard for students to read the questions as they just display on the board. It would also be useful to have a setting so that questions could also be displayed on their screen. This means students who are start away from the board will also be able to read the questions. You used to be able to click the question and the answers would display. At the moment their is a pause between the question and the answers displaying.
 I don't like the character limit on the answers.
 Sometimes students get so excited that they can't contain themselves and get rowdy.
 I don't dislike anything this is because when l find anything that l dislike l just change.
" Unfortunately, you couldn't create a slideshow with multiple types of integration, and it's impractical to design the separate display of pictures for a few survey questions."
" Lo peor de kahoot es que en pleno concurso, en ocasiones algunos alumnos sufren desconexiones del juego y se quedan fuera, algo que genera siempre polémica al no saber el organziador como compensarlos, o saber si ha sido a posta por aprte del alumno o por culpa del programa en sí."
" The urgency stresses some students out, and it doesn't hold ALL students accountable."
There isn’t much to complain about at this point. Kahoot! provided exactly what it needed to - does what it says on the box!
If you have poor internet connection... Its a problem but not that big... You.can still use it
Nothing to dislike - it works great for me and my students!
"Sometimes the compatibility with videos for the questions is rough. Also, sometimes the site will kick kids out mid game and they cannot finish with the rest of the class."
I honestly can't think of any single thing that I dislike about this product.
I can't think of anything I don't like. It's a fun game with numerous play options and ready made games!
Some participants do not like the timed nature of the program as it can bring about a lot of competition amongst groups.
I really don't have anything that I dislike or find challenging about using kahoot.
I don’t like how points are given for speed and accuracy because it makes my kids get trigger happy and choose answers before they think.
 It might get slower when the players are over 200.
 It can be complicated to figure out how to use the program if it is a first time user.
 I wish there was an option for the answers to also show up on the screen when students are playing a game.
 I think some content should be moderated better. Not everything on the platform is great so maybe some should just be private
 Every pupils needs internet access on their device
 ANYONE CAN JOIN SOME GROUPS WITH A DIFFERENT NAME MAKING THEM ANONYMOUS
 Can't really use for content questions. It is great for polling questions
" Kahoot allows students to remain anonymous so they could ""fake"" participation during class activities and randomly choose answers. The software also lags at times which takes into the classroom time, so a full round is not always played. The time constraints can also cause some anxiety for students, which can lead them to not want to participate."
 Lo peor de Kahoot es que en ocasiones el número de caracteres máximo permitido para redactar las respuestas se queda demasiado corto.
" Cuando hay muchos usuarios participando, se han detectado casos en que algunos querdan desconectados en mitad de la sesión."
" Hace falta un cañón, una pantalla y un ordenador master para realziar una prueba con Kahoot."
" Sometimes a glitch can cause the game to freeze before revealing the answers so it leaves everyone to guess which can, in turn, mess up the scores and make that question invalid."
 Here is another answer In which I will say there is not one negative thing I can say about this program please try Kahoot it.com.
 Does not allow students to pace themselves.
 It would be nice if different formats were available for a more professional look vs the current style
 It is best when it is used with a WiFi connection otherwise some answers do not get recorded in a timely manner making it frustrating for players/staff who answered correctly and in a faster time.
Could do a better job at modifying game to fit various need of students
Only having the shapes show up on my students screen which may interfere with processing speeds for students who have to try and transfer what they see as answers on the board to what is on their screen
"There is not much to dislike with this program. Because it relies on the internet, your connection can sometimes cause slow responses. This is not a problem specific to Kahoot!"
"When joined in the game at a maximum level, the system might slow down. For example, if 500 people play at the same time, it gets reallu slow."
"Can not create ""multiple answer"" questions. Also the limit of characters"
Se echa en falta más cantidad de caracteres en la escritura del enunciado de cada pregunta y respuesta.
"A veces, cuando hay muchos participantes, hay problemas en algunos de ellos con la conexión al servidor con la consecuente pérdida de puntos en el juego."
"Algunos alumnos, al ver que van con menos puntos que el resto pueden perder el interes por el juego, hay que tratar de mantener su compromiso con el juego hasta que se acabe."
Si se corta la conexión a internet el juego se cancela.
 Students have freedom to create their own names that show up on the screen before the teacher can proof them. This can allow for inappropriate words to show up on the screen and interfere with a smooth implementation of the tool.
 Lo que menos me gusta de kahoot es que para preparar uno en condiciones requiere mucho tiempo.
" En ocasiones, si son muchos los dispositivos del personal conectados, pueden fallar."
" Si no tienes una sala de conferencias reservada con cañón de luz y dispositivos para todos, no tiene sentido hacer el kahoot, pues todos los miembros del equipo deben estar cerca."
 Vas a necesitar conexión a internet.
" Cada uno de los participantes necesita un dispositivo, ya sea un smatphone, tablet, portátil o pc de escritorio."
 El administrador necesita de un equipo informático con un cañon o retroproyector.
" Se necesita reservar la sala de reuniones para que todos puedan participar haciendo equipo y escuchándose, mientras observan lo proyectado."
 El administrador necesita dedicarle bastante tempo de dedicación para preparar la modalidad de uso.
" Si hay problemas de red algunos usuarios pueden quedar desconectados en mitad del uso, siendo su regreso complicado pues pierden todos los puntos obtenidos."
" En el colegio es gratuito, pero la versión pro con amplias características de uso en empresas es de pago."
" This is a pretty simple program, and I haven't run into anything I don't like."
 It takes long to load and sometimes the timing is off
 It can be slow and the music gets annoying.
" It can be a bit slow at times, and there isn’t a variety of options"
 It is difficult to put higher level math problems with their specific annotations on Kahoot.
 It isn't that easy to explain where people need to enter the code
 A downside of using this platform is that it requires internet . Also keeping track of students individually when answering questions can be hard over time.
 It does not record data for individuals when doing a live quiz
 Sometimes is is a little slow on the uptick and the app does not integrate well with the web version of Kahoot.
 It’s sometimes slow and glitchy but it’s fine most of them time
 Sometimes creating a quiz can feel a little painstaking.
" Everyone has to complete the question at the same time, and if someone gets disconnected and you don't know right away, you may be waiting a long time as you don't know if a student is just taking a while to think about the question or if they aren't connected or if they are participating."
 I wish the data was easier to retrieve for teacher analysis.
" The higher the number of participants gets, the slower the system goes."
" While there isn't anything I necessarily dislike about the software, I might recommend adding more options to make quizzes look more professional. It is fun to use with younger students, but it can come off as a little bit unpolished when working with an older group."
 I honestly can’t think of anything I do not like.
"The initial setup and connection to Educational technology such as the clickers, computers, or tablets can be lengthy, but once it's setup it's worth it!"
The character limits on the questions/responses.
The time allotted slot should be longer.
I only dislike that I cannot easily print out a version of ghe quiz for students with special needs who might benefit from having a printed version.
There's nothing that I dislike! It's user friendly and there are so many kahoots to choose from for every topic!
No issues at all. My only recommendation would be some type of training so I could fully utilize all it has to offer
"The default music is a bit much. Allowing students to select their own usernames helps them feel safe to make mistakes, but also results in a lot of poop emojis in the nicknames."
"At the moment, we can't put the quizzes in folders. That would be very practical."
Only thing can suggest is to make it easier to add other music and pictures
" students have to be monitored at their computers since they can switch screens/tabs and do something else during the game, doesn't keep track of individual student 'scores' or points for easy grading"
 Kahoot!'s setup couldn't be better. More pre made sets would be a bonus.
 The user interface is a bit clunky. Wish I didn't have to give them the account password so that they can add questions.
 Everyone needs their own device and some of my students do not.
 Nothing. It works perfectly for us. There is nothing I would change
" the kids can make their own username, which sometimes uses bad words."
" Kahoot can sometimes lag on the user end, as all users besides the administrator of the game are playing on their own device. They connect to the game with a code, and sometimes students screens load faster than others, allowing them to answer quicker. Points are given based on quickness to answer, so this can be unfair to those that have faster or newer devices."
 I do not dislike this program at all!!!!
 Sometimes it lags when a lot of people use it.
" I bought an access to the kahoot for commercial purposes. And it did not work properly on the conference. People have been connecting through their phones and many of them were not able to connect, sometimes only answers from few people have been counted. It was a disaster! You should not offer that for commercial purposes if this does not work with big groups of people, like 500 people. And do not blame internet: wifi was fine and event with 3G internet it was hanging. This is your kahoot website which is not adjusted to big traffic."
" I wish there was a feature where students could draw their responses. In math, this would be very helpful during graphing chapters."
 I dislike that sometimes the link to get into Kahoot does not work.
" Having to submit a game pin each team can be cumbersome. However, at the moment, there is nothing I dislike about the product."
 The features are hard to display on smartphone platform (the answer choices don't appear correctly and this confuse smartphone users)
 I am impressed with everything about this product.
"There is nothing about Kahoot that I don't like, we do sometimes have an issue with it freezing but I think that is our b uilding WiFi."
There isn't a whole lot I dislike about Kahoot. It is easy to use and it is very engaging. I guess one think I would like to see is a way to categorize your saved games.
I wish I could input it invite students by name.
I do not like how often students get bumped out of the game. Upon rejoining the game they lose their status
The kids don't have enough time to think.
I haven't found anything I dislike. It can be used on apps and on desktops.
"Too much fun, sometimes I lose control of the class. It is all good, though."
There’s not anything in particular other than not showing the answers on the screen and rather just shapes
The Details of feedback data given. It could go deeper per question.
 Some of the answers are incorrect. There should be some monitoring of the answers.
 I dislike that they require a time limit for the questions.
 Sometimes the site crashes and doesnt allow a save spot
" While there are many different options for creating questions, sometimes I wish there was a way to adjust all of the time settings at once instead of going through each question individually."
 Gets old and boring after a couple times playing
 Students are on phones during class time.
" I can't really think of anything I dislike. If I don't find something there that suits my needs, I just create my own."
 Some pre-made quizzes have inappropriate/ incorrect answers.
" There isn't anything I would say that I really dislike; it does what it is supposed to do and meets my expectations for what I want to use it for, which is simple, engaging skill review games."
" I wish there were more pre-made quizzes to search from. Also, I wish I could easily search for pictures, videos, and music to add to my Kahoots."
" There is nothing big that I dislike about Kahoot! It is easy to use and search for quizzes, but I guess one downside is that sometimes the answers to the quizzes made by other users are incorrect, so that affects the scores of the students. Another downside is that if I want to go over a problem because I noticed that many students had an incorrect answer, I can't see the problem/question after the answer is revealed."
" It is not insanely quick to make a Kahoot!, though it could be if there were a way to import a spreadsheet. I am fairly tech savvy so that would be a great option for me."
 Need more ways to save data and put grades into Powerschool
 The use of the software can be over-done. You need to make sure you use the software strategically in your room.
I actually really enjoy the whole program
"It can get a little crazy and some students just guess really fast trying to get the most points, rather than thinking through the question. There are ways to use it more as an assessment/survey, but the kids don't have fun with that."
"It does take some front loading, especially for my art history class since I have to have content and images but once it’s done it’s worth it."
"I don't like that only multiple choice questions are possible, but I can understand why that's the way things are."
I think for some students it is negative that there is a score system that favors speed over quality. I have seen it many times that some errors result through this flaw.
Can get some getting used to. Not as bad as other solutions out there.
"It lags a lot at times which is a bummer because, during timed quizzes, it cannot give an accurate representation of the winner. It also consumes a lot of the battery because my phone heats up so much every time I use it. Regardless, I love Kahoot!"
"I dislike the fact that there are by more options for the backgrounds and color selections for the toolbars, etc."
Some quizzes are inaccurate in the spelling. It is contradictory when using these quizzes in the esl practice when there are some errors/typos in the language.
" Sometimes the site glitches or goes slow. It just depends on your WIFI and how many students you have participating. This quiz also requires the use of some sort of device which not all classrooms have (Ipad, smartphone, laptop)."
 That everyone has to go at the same pace of the question. This is not a platform that can be easily implemented with my students who are on an educational plan and need more time.
" I like to assign for homework, but haven't quite been able to figure out how to have students play multiple times for reinforcement. I would say that's not as user friendly as the program typically is. Other than that, I have no complaints."
 The Kahoot team need to allow for real-time student collaboration while making the Kahoots! It's an awesome tool but is so far mostly being to a fraction of its potential. If the students actually make the Kahoots it enables far deeper and more active engagement. I've built a scaffold that works around the design flaws to empower students to create their own: https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FREE-Student-friendly-Kahoot-Scaffold-3447507
" I wish it allowed subjective responses as well instead of just multiple choice responses. I also think that there are some bugs in the software because it freezes many time, and that is not fun especially when there is a match going on!"
 I do not like how students do not have the possible answers on their individual computers. You only see the different colors to pick from instead of the answers. It makes it difficult for students because they are forced to look up at the screen and sometimes make a silly mistake by picking the wrong color because they werent looking.
" When I'm in spaces with less than stellar internet, the student devices can lag. If the students have to wait to enter their response it lowers their score and they get really frustrated. The font sizes can't be controlled by the user. That sometimes means I have to read the question to the students. The character limit is challenging sometimes. I get around it by adding an image with the text I need, but that's tedious."
" While I do like the game quality of Kahoot, I'm not a huge fan of how it awards points for first to answer when the question immediately appears. I wish there was a frame of seconds that it recorded as the same number of points because I have a lot of students randomly guessing in hope of getting a lot of points."
" As students race to get the best score, they can prioritize speed over accuracy. It is good to remind students that string correct answers together will get them bonus points so answering it correctly is more important than answering it quickly"
" The music, quite frankly, is obnoxious. There's also been times when I wished I could do more on the actual platform, like adding videos and more pictures to the individual question. Some of our classes deal with art, entertainment, and the like, and it would be nice to be able to use more media."
 I also find it frustrating how limited the characters are when you are trying to write out a question and answer. Give us more characters!
" I think the functionality is great, there aren't many things I dislike. However, some pre-made questions would be helpful to get your juices flowing when creating one."
" They don’t have professional options than Google Forms, but it does not have to be. I absolutely love Kahoot."
 I would love to see Kahoot extend their time limits beyond 120 seconds. It's not always easy to limit students with math disabilities to 2 minutes for processing and answering a question. It limits me to what type of questions I can use.
" I don't love that it doesn't allow for written responses but instead only multiple choice, or true/false. If they could have a few extra seconds to type in a response it could allow for creativity in using the game and for an overall different approach to quizzing them."
 Not much. It was very useful. Did not like that it was not uncommon for students to use expletives and inappropriate language when they were signing in for the kahoot quiz and giving a name.
 I enjoy this software. My main problem is the word limit on questions---some practice questions require more context and I'd like to be able to provide a realistic question for students. It is troubling to shorten questions when I'm over the word limit and I have to pick and choose what contextual data to remove from the question.
I wish you could have longer questions and answers (limited by number of characters). Wish you could pull media through more venues like direct uploads for videos.
It is cumbersome and time consuming to create a game from scratch. I would also like better image integration.
"I have dealt with a lot of glitches with Kahoot. The game would freeze at many points, and additionally, it is very limited in its scope allowing only multiple choice questions up to 4 answers."
Some times you loose the test because of server connectivity issue.
it's working slowly and almost everytime on android smartphones. You have to do something for that. And that would be better if both questions and answers show on the device.
It takes a test run or two to figure out how it works before using with students.
"Sometimes it takes too long to load or freezes on the device which defeats the purpose of a quiz, and it's no use at that time. Also, students are only able to see the symbols rather than the real options when answering making it difficult for them to answer correctly."
In the past I have had some glitches with the game. Some students will be kicked out (on their iPad) mid game and have to reenter (which frustrates them because they want to keep up their winning streak!).
"There is not much that I dislike about Kahoot - I was concerned about students being able to pick their own usernames, however, I am able to kick the username out if I do not approve."
" This tool isn't used a lot amongst the older crowd, so it can be difficult to get people to buy into this tool."
" I dislike the connectivity issues we sometimes experience. Whether on wifi or on data, students occasionally have trouble with the app and website going too slow and they miss out on answering their question, or they are penalized by the time."
 The time component of the game is handled in such a way that interaction is more superficial in nature to increase speed of response
 Nothing so far.
" It is simple, but I actually like that because it makes it easy to use."
" It would be good if there were more quizzes in Spanish in the library, especially for Science and Language Arts."
" I sort of dislike the layout for the buttons used for answering the questions on the application that is downloaded to the phone. It is not a big issue, however I do find students tend to struggle from looking at the screen for the answers to looking on the phone to make sure they chose the right color and shape for the correct answer."
 I don't like how frequently my students are able to get out of a kahoot to somehow cheat--they should not be allowed to leave their screens.
" The site can be slow on some computers, which can frustrate a student trying to play along with their classmates."
 The entire set up looks childish. The game features make the polling and content it produces look unprofessional. Also it requires access instructions.
 Long text entry answers would be nice. Subjective answers add to multiple choice options. Sometimes it can be a bit buggy and hard to unfreeze it. It can be a bit draining on the battery too.
 There are some limitations in game creation that feel like road blocks. I think they should create more freedom for the user to build their own Kahoot! Interactive experience online.
" I wish I had the ability to do a in-the-moment-quiz or review activities. Currently, all Kahoots must be pre-made ahead of time. This is an ability that Socrative was able to create."
 The data presented is a bit clunky at times. I wish I could open it within the browser va downloading all scores
" It has a few limitations on the presentation, but I've been able to work around that by incorporating images with the sentences, etc. to make it work a little better."
" I don't like that students have to look at their computer screen and the large classroom screen simultaneously. It can be hard for some students. It is also really just a review game. Since it is multiple choice, it's more of just a way to introduce a topic or review topics and it is extremely difficult to incorporate higher-level thinking."
" You can only put an image on the page with the question, not as answer choices."
 I do not dislike how easy it is to get kicked out of the program.
"nothing, its easy to use and fun, my students love it"
I don't like how the points are awarded according to how fast people answer questions. I wish there was a better scoring system to demotivate students because students try to make random guesses instead of actually properly answering the questions.
"I dislike how small the answers are in the colored boxes on the screen, so it is hard for all students to see them."
The only thing I cant think of is you have to be careful with is building the survey itself. It's not as flexible if you are building it as you go. I find it easier to build the survey on a word document and copy/paste this info.
There is nothing I dislike about the program. It is easy to use and to set up.
It is tedious to enter questions but not sure there's an easier way. It's well worth it for the results.
"Nothing! The formatting options could be altered to offer more types, however."
"my Students would prefer that the answer choices be on their device and not just on the big screen. For students with any sort of visual tracking issue, they give up so easily."
I wish it was easier to use and that it tracked more data for me. It is really hard to search the database for pre-made Kahoots made by colleagues. I wish it was sorted by grade or subject.
" As far as its intention, there is nothing that I dislike about it."
 can be a bit confusing to set up. userface needs a bit of refreshing.
 Some of the set up for the questions is very tedious.
 The only thing I dislike is that I have to click off the naughty nicknames when one of my students thinks he’s being slick.
 I personally love the music on Kahoot but most people I know hate it. Additionally it is very limited in its scope allowing only multiple choice questions up to 4 answers.
 I like everything about it. There is nothing that I dislike. It’s a great invention!
 I dislike how they changed the interface making adding new questions a bit of a pain.
" There have been some bugs recently, so the quiz kicks students off midway through a quick, which skews the results."
" Very slow at times. When there is a heavy load on the website, it just freezes on a lot of devices."
 There was nothing I didn't like. The site is easy to use and made learning fun and easy.
 I dislike the internet ability and connection with it.
" It would be great if this worked with Google forms so that you could load in a Google form directly. It used to be difficult to copy and paste text into the questions, but now that has become easier. Additionally, adding pictures has become much easier."
" Not a whole lot. I think the interface could be a little bit smoother. Perhaps different choices in music. And also more options, as once you've done them a few times, it gets a bit old for the audience."
 I wish I could add my own music to play for the questions
 What I dislike the most is the lack of filters to search for games that are relevant to what I am teaching.
" Sometimes it takes too long to load or freezes on the device which defeats the purpose of a quiz, and it's no use at that time."
A little too simplistic. Only good option is for multiple choice questions.
Students can use their smartphones which sometimes leads to difficulty monitoring
"I wish there were more ""math-friendly"" characters to choose from."
I dislike that students must have an electronic device- sometimes the devices malfunction and the student will get logged out.
"The only thing I wish were not there is the character limit on the multiple choice responses. Sometimes I need to have longer responses for translations, and that limit prevents me from giving full answers. I used to dislike that I could not copy and paste from word, but that has been fixed. It would also be great to have a short answer option where all the answers appeared on the screen. It would also be great to have a more open ended survey option. There are also times where more than four answers may be appropriate for an answer, and that option would be helpful."
"Sometimes students can't connect or the connection is slow. However, these issues are really minimal."
I dislike nothing at all! Long live Kahoot!
There is nothing I dislike about this web tool
It limits the amount of characters you can write.
 The time limit rushes students and they click quickly without thinking the question through.
 Would like to see some more pre made quizzes from experienced educators that are “verified.” Not just standard users.
 I can't always fit the entire answer I would like to use in the space allowed.
 There is nothing I dislike about this product.
 I didn't have any dislikes during my time using Kahoot! throughout my time as an instructor
 Each player has to have their own device. When played in the classroom (not the computer lab) not every student could play.
" Unfortunately, it is not compatible with certain devices which causes lag in the delivery of the responses."
 Locating quality Kahoots can be challenging.
" At the moment, I don't have anything about Kahoot! that I dislike."
 The only downfall is that students need to have either 1:1 devices or access to enough devices for them to work in teams. This can be challenging in schools without much technology available.
" The background music is stressful, but otherwise no complaints"
 Can be complicated for non-digital natives
 Can be exclusionary for students without compatible phones
" Strong reliance on connectivity, which can be an issue in some context"
 I don't like the fact that occasionally some random person who's isn't supposed to be a participant joins the game with a vulgar name.
 there is nothing about kahoot that i dislike
 I wish it had more grading options and easier ways to create new kahoots
I wish that more students could use Kahoot at the same time.
I wish there were a math equation software available to use to write problems.
I do not like that if a Student uses an inappropriate name - I can not PERMANENTLY get rid of the student. I also do not like how the code can be shared with unauthorized users throughout the school.
Having an electronic device for each student is sometimes a challenge.
"Nothing, this program is great for training and studying"
I wish it allowed me to create un-timed polls or for students to enter free-choice answers.
The lack of autosave and autopublish really causes me problems if I forget to click the right buttons on the way out.
Each student must have a device with internet capabilities to answer the questions.
Software lags sometimes and has trouble connecting to devices before quizzes begin
The time it takes to make a new activity
The wait time for an entire class to join can be tricky - the quiz resets if someone joins late.
Could do with more customization options
"Not much! It's easy to use, create and share"
"The performance with larger groups is unreliable sometimes, but that may have something to do with network reliability. Also, it's difficult to use it to instruct, but it's great for review."
Nothing really. It seems to work well. They like it.
I don't like the fact that strangers join the game sometimes.
There are times at which the interface can be a little glitchy.
I don't really dislike anything about this program.
"I wish their was a way to sync it with Google Docs or Google sheets, although that might be a feature that is coming soon."
I wish I could type longer answers because I often end up cutting them off.
"I dislike that some students can make weird usernames, which can slow things down."
Only certain types of questions/polls work for Kahoot! It is better as a poll than as a knowledge quiz.
Sometimes the pages hang and the responses take a while to go
"Honestly, nothing. My students LOVE this program!"
Students without a device cannot utilize the program
"The music gets a little redundant. I do not find the format for adding and editing questions as easy and stream lined as it should be. The way the bottom bar allows you to toggle when editing questions is not user-friendly. I wish the questions went vertically when editing, and that you could see all at one time, almost like Quizlet does. This only lets you view one section at a time."
No complaints! It has a very user friendly interface!
It takes a long time to create a new game for students to play.
I wish it had a Teams mode where students could collaborate on answers
I wish that the process of creating new questions was a bit more streamlined but the newest version does make it easier to add new questions.
"I dislike that Kahoot doesn't allow for different question styles and formats beyond the basic multiple choice or true or false options that it currently has available. Also, it might be fun to be able to customize Kahoot more by changing fonts, colors, or background schemes."
"Kahoot is very competitive, so often students are guessing just to be the fastest person or accidentally click on wrong answer because the device does not show the question or responses. Students are able to create their own names, which can quickly become inappropriate. Because of the nature of the quiz, it takes a long time after each question to regain the class's attention."
Lack of student access to create their own slides and track their progress. I wish this application had a Kahoot classroom as other applications have. It would be great for students to have access to Kahoot Classroom and create their own kahoot presentations and quizzes. If students had access to a kahoot classroom teachers could have students work on specific topics for review and assessments.
"As with most online learning tools, not all of the students at my university have smart phones or tablets, and it therefore requires some additional planning on my part to ensure that some library tablets are available for use for those students without their own equipment, to allow them to participate as well."
"If you're planning on using Kahoot with a large crowd, you must ensure you have the bandwidth to support it. Although Kahoot is optimized for the web via a mobile device, I would still prefer a native Android and iOS app. Finally, there tend to be some glitches when creating Kahoots on Chrome. I wish there was an option to display the question on the student devices. While I understand the research behind this, for some visually impaired students or when presenting to a very large group, it is necessary to have the question on the user's device."
It would be great if there were a copy/paste option for images rather than having to upload them.
The only thing I disliked about Kahoot was that it doesn't allow you to edit any of the questions and answers that have been created by other teachers. Being able to do this would allow us to cater the information to our classroom.
"Kahoot is a great tool for my students but as a teacher, I am not able to edit the questions or answers that other individuals have created. I would love the ability to edit the questions and answers to my liking and then be able to save the edit to a profile."
"There is really nothing that I dislike, it is a great product!"
"It takes a lot of time to build Kahoot games. However, searching for ones that are already created helps to ease this obstacle."
kids can simply just click on an answer without figuring out the problem
Leaderboards can force student to compete too much and lose focus on the content.
I wish that you could combine quizzes for review activities.
